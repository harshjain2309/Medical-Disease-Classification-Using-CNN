🧠 Medical Disease Classification Using Deep Learning
A unified deep learning framework designed to automate diagnosis of four critical medical conditions — Pneumonia, Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer, and Skin Cancer — using image data (X-rays, CT scans, ultrasound, dermatoscopic images) with CNNs and Transfer Learning.

📌 Project Objective
To create an AI-powered, explainable diagnostic system that:

Automates classification of multiple diseases using CNNs.

Supports real-time predictions with high accuracy.

Enhances medical decision-making with Grad-CAM explainability.

Works efficiently on both cloud and edge devices.
